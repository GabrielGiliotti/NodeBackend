  wsl --install -d Ubuntu

  reference link: https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/wsl/install

Using WSL on Windows 11

- After the installation, open the "Start" menu on the taskbar and search for "Ubuntu"
- Open the "Ubuntu" app as admin

- Execute the following command on Ubuntu shell:

  cd ../../mnt/c/Users/gabri/Desktop

  (this command put your current diretory on WSL in the Desktop directory from Windows, but is not a mandatory command)


Using the Telnet in WSL with localy hosted API on Windows  

- Run your API in your local machine (localhost:port) - It is different for each technology used
- Open the Command prompt on Windows as Admin and execute the following command:

  ipconfig /all

- Search for "Ethernet vEthernet (WSL)"
- Get the Ipv4 address and copy
- Execute the following command on WSL prompt:

  telnet <Ipv4-address> <api-port>

- Then, for a simple GET request, define the method, headers and content as follow:

GET <api-path> HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:<port>

- If is a POST request, similary do:

POST <api-path> HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:<port>
Content-type: application/json
Content-length: <body-length>

<body as json>

Node API HTTPS Configuration

- To create the key and certificate for https with openssl, open your command prompt in API directory and run:

  openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout server.key -out server.crt

- Then, import https lib in the server control file and update the server using the https protocol:

Node Example (the implementation is different for another technology - search for documentations):

const https = require("https"); // import

https.createServer({
  key: fs.readFileSync('server.key'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server.crt')
}, server).listen(8000, () => {
   console.log("API dispon√≠vel em https://localhost:8000")
});

- To read the content of the certificate file, you can run "cat server.crt", but all the data is croptographed, run 
  the following command to see the content (OBS: run the commands in WSL):

  openssl x509 -in server.crt -text

- To read the content of key file run the following command:

  openssl rsa -in server.key -text -noout

* When a request is made, before the client send your data, the server send the certified to the client that 
  contains the public key, which in turn validates whether the server is really "who" it says it is and encrypt 
  your data before send
